This directory is on conditionals and loops in Python; and writing user-defined python functions base on scope of variables, trackback and arithmetic operators.
A snippet of each file function is given below:

- 0-positive_or_negative.py: Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and prints whether number is positive or negative.
- 1-last_digit.py: Python program that assigns a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed and prints its last digit.
- 2-print_alphabet.py: Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
- 3-print_alphabt.py: Python program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
- 4-print_hexa.py: Python program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and hexadecimal.
- 5-print_comb2.py: Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 two digits each.
- 6-print_comb3.py: vPython program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits in ascending order.
- 7-islower.py: Python function that checks for lowercase characters.
- 8-uppercase.py: Python function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.
- 9-print_last_digit.py: Python function that prints the last digit of a number.
- 10-add.py: Python function that returns the addition of two integers.
- 11-pow.py: Python function that returns a to the power of b.
- 12-fizzbuzz.py: Python function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 followed by a space.
- 13-insert_number.c: C function that inserts a number into a sorted linked list.
- 100-print_tebahpla.py: Python program that prints the alphabet in reverse order, alternating lowercase and uppercase, not followed by a new line.
- 101-remove_char_at.py: Python function that creates a copy of a string without the character at position n.
- 102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly the provided bytecode.
- lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 13-insert_number.c.

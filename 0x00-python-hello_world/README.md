This directory is an introduction to Python language. Use of Python interpreter, printing text and variables, indexing and slicing strings in Python is practiced in this directory.
A snippet of each file function is given below:

- 0-run: Bash script that runs a Python script file saved in the environment variable $PYFILE.
- 1-run_inline: Bash script that runs Python code saved in the environment variable $PYCODE.
- 2-print.py: Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line using the function print."
- 3-print_number.py: Python script that prints the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
- 4-print_float.py: Python script that prints the float stored in the variable number with a precision of two digits.
- 5-print_string.py: Python script that prints a string stored in the variable str three times, then a new line, then the first nine characters contained in str, followed by another new line.
- 6-concat.py: Python script that prints Welcome to Holberton School! using the variables str1 = "Holberton" and str2 = "School".
- 7-edges.py: Python script that sets three string variables based on the string contained in the variable word.
- 8-concat_edges.py: Python script that prints object-oriented programming with Python, followed by a new line without creating new variables or string literals.
- 9-easter_egg.py: Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters, followed by a new line.
- 10-check_cycle.c: C function that checks if a linked list contains a cycle.
- 100-write.py: Python script that prints exactly and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19, followed by a new line to stderr using the function write from the sys module.
- 101-compile: Python script that compiles a Python script file stored in the environment variable $PYFILE and saves it to an output file $PYFILEc.
- 102-magic_calculation.py: Python function matching exactly a bytecode provided by Holberton School.
- lists.h: Header file containing definitions and prototypes for all types and functions used in linked_lists.c and 10-check_cycle.c.
